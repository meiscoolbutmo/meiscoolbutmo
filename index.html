        <p >This website is still under construction.</p>
        <p >Hello, I'm Logan, and I go by the alias meiscoolbutmo (note: this includes abandoned AI tools as I used to be pro-AI but have since moved on, don't worry, those accounts are inactive). Anybody identifying themselves on the internet as "meiscoolbutmo" as of 2025 is me. I mainly create content such as gaming, astronomy, animation, or blends of those three with or without surrealist or absurdist themes.</p>
        <hr class="lineCreatureMcNuggets">
        <h1 >Upcoming Youtube Content</h1>
        <p >There is some content that is planned, and hasn't came out yet. This stuff is basically confirmed to happen at some point in the future of the MEISCOOLBUTMO channel:</p>
        <div style="height: 35px;"></div>
        <p >•Whenever Billie Bust Up comes out, I will stream it, maybe in one whole sitting</p>
        <p >•A new space size comparison is in production and will probably be released in early 2026</p>
        <p >•The vague idea of "gaming with another person" appeals to me, so there might be friend gaming</p>
        <div style="height: 35px;"></div>
        <p >One thing to note about these is that they aren't super specific and the dates are subject to change, largely because I am the ruler of procrastination.</p>

        <h1 >What can a planet be?</h1>
        <p >People are often under the assumption that the IAU's definition of a planet is the objectivley correct definition and the only definition that exists or is true. I'm here to tell you that mindset is completely false. Sure, the IAU definition that demoted Pluto and dropped the official count to 8 is "official", but that doesn't make it universal.</p>
        <div style="height: 35px;"></div>
        <p >I am going to pitch my idea for waht a planet should be here. It's designed to make large, geologically interesting objects planets while still seperating 'moon' from 'planet'.</p>
        <hr class="lineCreatureMcNuggets">
        <h1 >Logan's Amazing Solar System Criteria</h1>
        <p >The L.A.S.S.C is a set of criteria I have put together to classify the Solar System. It divides into the four major categories: Asteroids, Worlds, Planets, and Stars, along with the more overlapping categories of Moons and Sattelites. By no means is the L.A.S.S.C official in any way, it is simply how I think space should be defined.</p>
        <div style="height: 35px;"></div>
        <p >A star is the easiest to define, under these rules, a star is a object currently fusing elements due to the pressure of gravity. The Sun is thus the only star in the Solar System.</p>
        <div style="height: 35px;"></div>
        <p >A world, in the context of the Solar System, is any object large enough to be mostly roundish due to its own gravity and/or differentaited into layers, alongside being too small to fuse any elements.</p>
        <div style="height: 35px;"></div>
        <p >A planet, however, is more exclusive. It first must be a world, and if geologically active in some way, it must be greater than 1,000 km in diameter, and if geologically dead or uninteresting (essentially a boring rock), it mustbe greater than 2,000 km in diameter. A planet must also orbit a star, orbit nothing, or be in a binary with another planet. Binary systems are defined here as two bodies that orbit eachother with a mass ratio of greater than 1:100. The exact number of planets is uncertain due to the mysterious nature of the Kupiter Belt, but according to these criteria, the Solar System has at least 10-12 planets, although settling on 15 isn't a stretch, those 15 being Mercury, Venus, Terra (the Earth), Luna (the Moon), Mars, Jupier, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, Haumea, Quaoar, Makemake, Gonggong, and Eris.</p>
        <div style="height: 35px;"></div>
        <p >An asteroid, in the context of the Solar system, is anything that doesn't fit into these categories. Natural Sattelites are objects too small to be in a binary that also orbit either an asteroid, world, or planet. A moon is the same thing but reserved to just orbit planets.</p>
        <hr class="lineCreatureMcNuggets">
        <h1 >What are the 15 planets like?</h1>
        <p >This part of the website is unfinished due to Logan's procrasination, sudden boredom, or need to play video games or work on a different creative project.</p>

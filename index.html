        <p >Hello, I'm Logan, and I go by the alias meiscoolbutmo (note: this includes abandoned AI tools as I used to be pro-AI but have since moved on, don't worry, those accounts are inactive). Anybody identifying themselves on the internet as "meiscoolbutmo" as of 2025 is me. I mainly create content such as gaming, astronomy, animation, or blends of those three with or without surrealist or absurdist themes.</p>
        <hr class="lineCreatureMcNuggets">
        <h1 >Upcoming Youtube Content</h1>
        <p >There is some content that is planned, and hasn't came out yet. This stuff is basically confirmed to happen at some point in the future of the MEISCOOLBUTMO channel:</p>
        <div style="height: 35px;"></div>
        <p >•Whenever Billie Bust Up comes out, I will stream it, maybe in one whole sitting</p>
        <p >•A new space size comparison is in production and will probably be released in early 2026</p>
        <p >•The vague idea of "gaming with another person" appeals to me, so there might be friend gaming</p>
        <div style="height: 35px;"></div>
        <p >One thing to note about these is that they aren't super specific and the dates are subject to change, largely because I am the ruler of procrastination.</p>

      <div id="aboutMe" data-tab-content>
        <h1 >A Quick Overview</h1>
        <p >My name is Logan and I was born in the United States on the 20th of January, 2011. Since around early 2017, I've lived very rural in the middle of nowhere, yet still "mysteriously" connected to the internet. I really like space and it's been a long-lasting intrest of mine since 2014-ish.</p>
        <div style="height: 35px;"></div>
        <p >I have one sister named Clara who was born in late 2014, three cats named Julea, Finn, and Wanda, a dog named Hank, several fish whom my sister Clara claims to know the names of, and a bearded dragon named XENA WARRIOR PRINCESS that my tragically middle aged dad absolutley adores.</p>
        <div style="height: 35px;"></div>
        <p >I like some video games like Minecraft, Terraria, and Kerbal Space Program. I've also streamed or made videos on a ot of other games like Wobblegods, Pikuniku, Indigo park, and Universe Sandbox 2, which I have had since around 2017.</p>
        <h1 >Dislikes</h1>
        <p >Most people list the things they like, but honestly, why do that when nobody is stopping you fron listing the things you don't like?</p>
        <div style="height: 35px;"></div>
        <p >Just be warned, some of these are hot takes:</p>
        <div style="height: 35px;"></div>
        <p >•I don't like sports, espescially American Football</p>
        <p >•I don't like seafood, most pasta (I know, sacrilegous), or most things tomato</p>
        <p >•I don't like it when people scream at me yet I love to scream myself</p>
        <p >•I don't like discrimination based on skin color, sex, gender, sexual orientation, diability, or any other factors</p>
        <p >•I don't like misinformation, pseudoscience, or conspiracy theories. If you have a conspiracy theory, I will out-conspiracy you to shut you up.</p>
        <p >•I don't like baths and instead strongly preffer showers</p>
        <div style="height: 35px;"></div>
        <p >Overall, I'm a difficult person, as you can clearly see. Lol.</p>

        <p >Hello, I'm Logan, and I go by the alias meiscoolbutmo (note: this includes abandoned AI tools as I used to be pro-AI but have since moved on, don't worry, those accounts are inactive). Anybody identifying themselves on the internet as "meiscoolbutmo" as of 2025 is me. I mainly create content such as gaming, astronomy, animation, or blends of those three with or without surrealist or absurdist themes.</p>
        <hr class="lineCreatureMcNuggets">
        <h1 >Upcoming Youtube Content</h1>
        <p >There is some content that is planned, and hasn't came out yet. This stuff is basically confirmed to happen at some point in the future of the MEISCOOLBUTMO channel:</p>
        <div style="height: 35px;"></div>
        <p >•Whenever Billie Bust Up comes out, I will stream it, maybe in one whole sitting</p>
        <p >•A new space size comparison is in production and will probably be released in early 2026</p>
        <p >•The vauge idea of "gaming with another person" appeals to me, so there might be friend gaming</p>
        <div style="height: 35px;"></div>
        <p >One thing to note about these is that they aren't super specific and the dates are subject to change, largely because I am the ruler of procrastination.</p>
